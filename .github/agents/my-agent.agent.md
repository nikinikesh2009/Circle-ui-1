🌀 WHAT “CIRCLE” REALLY IS — FULL EXPLANATION (FOR USERS)

📱 Circle is a smart social platform that builds communities around your interests.
You don’t scroll endlessly like in other apps — here, you belong to your kind of people.

Everything inside Circle revolves around “Circles” — living spaces based on topics, passions, and communities.

============================================================
🏡 HOW CIRCLE WORKS (USER JOURNEY)

1. 🧑 Account Creation & Personal Behavior Tracking

When you create your account, you set your interests and profile.

As you use the app — what you search, ask, and chat about — the AI silently learns what topics you like.

Based on this real behavior, AI recommends the best Circles to join.

Example: If someone constantly talks about Python in chat, AI may suggest joining:
• “Python Developers Circle”
• “AI & Machine Learning Circle”
• “Tech Community Circle”



2. 🫂 Join Existing Common Circles

Circle already has a set of pre-built, official Circles, such as:
• AI & Tech
• Python Programming
• Arduino
• Fitness Goals
• Gamers
• Music Lovers
• Relationship Advice

Anyone can join or leave these with a single tap.

These common circles stay on the Home screen for easy access.



3. 🧠 AI Auto-Created Circles (Trend-Based)

The AI constantly listens to what people talk about across the platform.

If 1000+ unique users request or talk about the same topic (e.g., “Arduino projects”), AI:

1. Creates a new trending Circle automatically.


2. Gives it a name, banner, and description.


3. Places it on the Home screen as a popular topic.



User-created circles that don’t reach this threshold remain in the Explore section.



4. 🧭 Explore Tab (User-Created Circles)

Anyone can request or create a new Circle on any topic they love.

These stay in the Explore tab until they trend.

Example:

“Arduino Lovers in Sri Lanka”

“Study Circle for Math Students”

“K-Pop Fans United”


People can browse, search, and join any community freely.



5. 💬 Circle Chat (Group Messaging)

Inside each Circle, members can:
• Chat in real time
• Share messages, images, or videos
• React to messages
• See who’s typing or online

AI is also part of the conversation: it suggests relevant Circles inside the chat itself.
Example:

If you keep asking Python questions in chat, AI will say:
👉 “You might like the Python Developers Circle.”




6. ✉️ Direct Messaging (DM)

Apart from Circle group chats, users can chat directly with each other privately.

Perfect for making close friends, study partners, or team members.

You can view who’s online and send instant messages in real time.



7. 🧍 Private vs Public Circles

Public Circles → Anyone can join, open communities.

Private Circles → Created by verified users or organizations, with admin controls.

Private Circles have:
• Owners/Admins
• Member management
• Optional AI moderation rules

AI still monitors for spam or harmful activity.



8. 🧠 AI Assistant — Your Guide Inside Circle

The AI isn’t just an assistant; it’s a community brain.

It:
• Suggests Circles based on your chat behavior
• Helps find like-minded people
• Creates trending Circles automatically
• Guides new users to discover what they love

Think of it as your personal guide to find your tribe.



9. 🔔 Notifications & Activity

Real-time notifications appear when:
• Someone joins your Circle
• A new message is posted
• A trending Circle is created in your topic of interest

The notification bell shows unread counts and live updates.



10. 🧭 User Profile & Recommendations



Your profile contains:
• Avatar, bio, interests
• Joined Circles
• Activity history

AI uses this to personalize your experience more over time.

The more you use Circle, the smarter it gets at understanding you.


============================================================
🧠 AI CIRCLE CREATION LOGIC

1,000+ unique users request the same topic → AI creates a new Circle.

Auto generates:
• Circle name
• Description
• Banner
• Placement on Home screen

Under 1,000 requests → stays in Explore.

This prevents spam and keeps the home clean and focused on hot topics.


============================================================
🛡 WHY CIRCLE FEELS DIFFERENT

No random feed or endless scrolling.

Your experience is personalized by AI, not algorithms trying to trap your time.

The most loved topics rise naturally, created by the community’s voice.

You don’t waste time searching — the right Circles find you.


============================================================
